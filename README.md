# Diabetes Prediction System

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive Diabetes Prediction System using various machine learning algorithms to classify patients into three categories: Non-Diabetic, Diabetic, and Pre-Diabetic. By comparing different models, we've developed a high-accuracy prediction system that can serve as a screening tool for diabetes risk assessment.

## Models & Performance

| Model                  | Accuracy | Key Features                                 |
|------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------|
| SVM (app.ipynb)        | 92.96%   | Baseline model with rbf kernel               |
| Enhanced SVM (app1.ipynb) | ~93%   | Improved preprocessing & error handling      |
| Random Forest (app2.ipynb) | 96.98% | Better non-linear handling & interpretability |
| Ensemble (app3.ipynb)  | 97.49%   | Feature engineering & multiple model voting   |

## Dataset

The dataset (`newDiabetes.csv`) contains important clinical parameters:

- **Demographics**: Gender, Age
- **Blood Chemistry**: Urea, Creatinine, HbA1c
- **Lipid Profile**: Cholesterol, TG, HDL, LDL, VLDL
- **Other Metrics**: BMI
- **Target**: CLASS (N: Non-diabetic, Y: Diabetic, P: Pre-diabetic)

## Key Findings

- **HbA1c** emerged as the most important predictor of diabetes
- **Feature engineering** (especially HbA1c/BMI ratio) significantly improved performance
- **Ensemble methods** outperformed single models consistently
- **Pre-diabetic** class was the most challenging to predict accurately

## Future Improvements
